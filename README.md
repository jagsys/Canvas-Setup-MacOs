## Mutagen

Install
```bash
brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-compose
```
# Canvas-lms

## Instalation

Create a code workspace where youâ€™ll place the application repositories
```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
```

Pull the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms.git
```

Run the script to set up a development environment with Docker automatically.
```bash
cd canvas-lms
./script/docker_dev_setup.sh
```
### During the script execution:
1. Provide your mac's password when asked (one time)
2. Press [y] to copy all the yml files from ./docker-compose/config to ./config 
3. Be patience...
4. Write _DROP_ when asked what to do with the current database
5. Type your email and password for the canvas admin account 
6. Type an organization's name for canvas
7. Choose [1] for the collection of usage data
8. Verify at the end of the script execution, the message "*\o/ Success!*"


## Running Canvas for the first time

1. Run
```bash
cd ~/workspace/canvas-lms
mutagen-compose up
```
2. Wait until all the compilation processes finish (be patience...)

3. Open canvas in your browser
```bash
open http://canvas.docker
```

4. Sign in with your admin credentials

5. Test functionality

6. Log out

7. Shutdown mutagen-compose from another terminal window
```bash
cd ~/workspace/canvas-lms
mutagen-compose down
```

## Running Canvas

**Tip:** to skip webpacker for compiling assets in every run, comment out: "__command: yarn run webpack__" in docker-compose.override.yml 
```bash
sed -i '' 's/command\:\ yarn\ run\ webpack/\#command\:\ yarn\ run\ webpack/' ~/workspace/canvas-lms/docker-compose.override.yml
```

1. Run
```bash
cd ~/workspace/canvas-lms
mutagen-compose up -d
```
2. Stop
```bash
cd ~/workspace/canvas-lms
mutagen-compose down 
```
# dory

Install
```bash
brew install dory
```

Download ~/.dory.yml configuration file  
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jagsys/Canvas-Setup-MacOs/main/dory.yml --output ~/.dory.yml
```

Disable dory's proxy service (canvas comes with its proxy)
```bash
cd ~; ruby -e 'require "yaml"; data = YAML.load_file ".dory.yml"; data["dory"]["nginx_proxy"]["enabled"] = false;  File.open(".dory.yml", "w") { |f| YAML.dump(data, f) }'
```

Change your dns configuration, to use dory as your dns service
```bash
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8
```

## Running dory
1. Run
```bash
dory up
```
2. Stop
```bash
dory down
```

Check dory's status
```bash
dory status
```

# Troubleshooting

## IP aliases 

* You should have this new IP address alias in you localhost interface [lo0]: *192.168.42.42*
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

* Verify if you receive a response when pinging to _canvas.docker_
```bash
ping canvas.docker
```
## Containers

After "mutagen-compose up" command execution, verify if you have these containers running
 * canvas-lms-jobs-1
 * canvas-lms-webpack-1
 * canvas-lms-redis-1
 * canvas-lms-mutagen-1
 * canvas-lms-web-1
 * canvas-lms-postgres-1
 * http-proxy

```bash
cd ~/workspace/canvas-lms
mutagen-compose up -d
sleep 30
docker inspect --format '{{.Name}}' $(docker ps -q)
```
